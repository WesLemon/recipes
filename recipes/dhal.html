    <img src="../images/dhal.png" alt="Creamy Lentil Dhal">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lentils are one of our favourite ingredients. High in fibre and protein, low in fat and, most importantly,
        tasty! Dhal is a classic dish that makes the most of these versatile pulses, and can easily be made gluten free
        and vegan too.
